<h2 id="project">📁 Practice Test </h2>
<p>This is the Coin Synch project Dashboard!
This dashboard is very simple, it contains information about the user's portfolio,
showing how many and which coins he has in his wallet.
</p>
<p>This page shows some additional information too, like NFTs News, and others.
It also allows the user to transfer their coins! The functionality is just a simulation.
</p>

> Feel free to contribute to this project! Remember that practice makes perfect.
